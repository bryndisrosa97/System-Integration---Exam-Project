# System Integration

## Introduction
In this project, we model a toll system comprising multiple stations linked to a motorway. The primary goal is to facilitate toll payments for vehicles entering or exiting the motorway. The toll rates vary based on the vehicle type: truck, car, or motorcycle. Our solution offers two payment methods: purchasing a single ticket using a credit card upon entry or obtaining a toll tag via a website for seamless check-in and check-out. Each station is equipped with a cashier to handle technological glitches or human errors. Additionally, every station has a manager with access to detailed station reports. An enterprise manager oversees the entire system, having the authority to access all station reports and adjust toll rates.

## Methodology Used

The project commenced with the development of the glossary, domain model, business activity diagram, and use cases as a collective effort. Subsequently, individual members were assigned specific use cases to detail and associated fit tests. These were later reviewed and refined by the group. The team also collaboratively crafted class diagrams, OCL constraints, LSMs, and sequence diagrams, with each member primarily responsible for certain scenarios. The primary tool utilized for collaboration was a Miro board, enabling simultaneous work and offering a comprehensive project overview.
